Scenario Based Examples To Configure Phone Numbers
Example – Location-Specific Setup
Scenario: The practice has clinics in Manchester and Wales.

Phone Number +441234567890 is assigned to Manchester.
Business hours: Mon–Fri, 9 AM – 5 PM.
Voicemail Box: Configured with “Manchester After-Hours” greeting.
Status: Active.
Result: Calls route correctly based on local hours, ensuring no lead is lost after hours.

Example – Marketing Campaign Tracking
Scenario: The marketing team launches a campaign on Google Ads.

A new phone number is provisioned.
Source: “Google Ads Spring Campaign”
Location: “Campaign – Virtual”
Voicemail: Custom greeting like:
“Thanks for responding to our special offer! We’ll get back to you shortly.”
Result: The campaign’s effectiveness is tracked via call logs tied to this specific number, and leads receive context-appropriate voicemail responses.

Example – Inactive Number Handling
Scenario: An older phone number from a now-closed location is still in the system.

Admin sets Status to “Inactive”.
Removes voicemail routing and disables working hours.
Result: Prevents calls from being routed to a defunct line and ensures operational integrity.
